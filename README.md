4.2 Interface design rules
In this section, it is explained how the system GUI will be developed according to a certain standard. 
Keep the interface simple
When developing the user interface, it is necessary to give the user only the required and essential inputs. Those will be the things that keeping the interface simple. Use of text boxes, labels, buttons etc.
Use of common UI elements
When taking whole system GUI into consideration, it should go into a certain pattern, layout and design. So the user will be familiarized when using the system for some time.
Page layout
I used aps.net MVC to generate page navigation links for each Web page. And use bootstrap, jQuery achieved some dynamic effect just to get the aesthetics to look a little interesting. I made a uniform of layout for the whole website. For example when designing the interface, similar types of inputs should be together. Such as register page and login page keep styles compatible.
Use of colors
When using colors in the system, should you something that is pleasant for the users and it should attract user’s attention. In our system, we will use white, grey-blue and dark grey and with a more uniform color images.  
4.3 Components available
The interface should always tell the user where he/she is and what things they want to do. For an example, the GUI should tell what necessary to enter and if the user enters something invalid, the system should tell the user where he/she could understand. For an example, the GUI should tell what necessary to enter and if the user enters something invalid, the system should tell the user where he/she could understand. For example when user register our website, click create an account button page will prompted user "email and password fields cannot be empty" and "Your password must contain a combination of letters and numbers."
 
 
 
4.4 Development system description
I use Adobe Dreamweaver to design this system. In that, the Form Designer allows to create the graphical user interface very easily. It can add subcomponents to classes, using property windows to design them and to create events.
Using the component designer, can add buttons, textboxes, labels, progress bars, combo boxes and many more components from the toolbox. By clicking a component, can change location, size, color, font sizes and many more properties of that component in properties window.
•	Button
       This component holds the functions of the system. When the user clicks the button, the event will activate.
•	Label
      The label helps to describe what the text boxes and interfaces means. This helps the user by giving an idea of the system.
•	Text Box
      The text boxes allow user to enter values through the interface. Also text boxes can be used for retrieve values and output through the text box.
•	Combo Box
       A combo box can store multiple values that can be selected on a user’s request. When the combo box is clicked, the drop down list will be appeared.
•	Map
       Map can show user our location and where is the nearest bike. Easy user to find and use.
